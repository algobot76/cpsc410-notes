\begin{itemize}
    \item Tokenization
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Process
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Pick ``\_'' as a reserved word.
                \item Read the entire program as a string without new lines.
                \item Replace all constant literals with ``\_$<$literal$>$\_''.
                \item Replace ``\_\_'' with ``\_''.
                \item Split on ``\_''.
                \item (If needed) pattern matches for non-constant literals during parsing.
            \end{itemize}
        \item Examples
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Tokenizer.java

        \item Define the ``parse'' method of each node.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Check the next token.
            \item Create a child node for a sub-statement.
            \item Parse on child nodes before continuing (recursive descent parsing).
        \end{itemize}
        \item Or do the parsing separately from the AST.
        \item Examples
        \begin{itemize}
            \item tinyHTML
            \item tinyDotStarter-parsingCompleted
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Stages of DSL Implementation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Tokenize
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Split your input into basic elements from your syntax.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Parse
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Check your syntax and build an internal representation (AST).
    \end{itemize}
    \item {[Validate]}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Enforce desired correctness properties for allowed programs (e.g. types).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Evaluate
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Execute program directly (DSL interpreter), or generate code to be run externally (DSL compiler).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Example: L2 (5-13)

\subsection{Recursive Evaluation and Visitor Pattern}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Recursive Evaluation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Process
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Start at the root of the AST.
            \item Carry out the work needed by the current node.
            \item Call ``evaluate'' recursively on all child nodes.
            \item Get the output by returning a value, modifying an existing object, printing, etc.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Examples
        \begin{itemize}
            \item tinyHTML
            \item tinyDotStarter-evaluationCompleted
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Visitor Pattern
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
        \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{visitor_pattern}
        \end{minipage}
        \item Defines external functionality over ASTs.
        \item Useful for refactoring ASTs.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Supports multiple kinds of evaluation.
            \item Separates AST evaluation from AST representation.
            \item Prevents violation against the Single Responsibility Principle.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Examples

            \item tinyDotStarter-Visitor
            \item tinyVars-Visitor
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Visitor Pattern and Double Dispatch}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Single dispatch: methods are dispatched based on the dynamic type of a single object (the receiver in Java).
    \item Visitor Pattern uses two single-dispatched method to simulate double dispatch (L4 (15-17)).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Every subclass of Node has an ``accept'' method.
        \item A call to the ``accept'' method is dynamically dispatched to the subclass, where the static type of ``this'' is the same as the dynamic type of ``this'' object.
        \item The we use it to select the indented (overloaded) ``visit'' method.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Double dispatch is important for code reuse.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item No need to change the code that represents ASTs.
        \item Easy to implement different visitors that make use of the ASTs for different purposes.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Attributes}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Properties of a named program element.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Name.
        \item Fact that it's a variable.
        \item Declaration site.
        \item Scope.
        \item Initialization status.
        \item Declared type.
        \item Current value.
        \item Location in memory.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Binding}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Associates attributes with names.
    \item Static (statically bound): known at/before compile time.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Declared variable types.
        \item Selecting between overloaded methods for a call.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Dynamic (dynamically bound): chosen only at runtime.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Calling overridden methods.
        \item Variable values.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation of TinyVars}

\begin{itemize}
    \item L5 (11-26)
    \item tinyVars-UndefAlias
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What Could Be Checked Statically/Dynamically?}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{what_could_be_checked}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A property in terms of dynamically-bound attributes cannot be checked statically
    \item A property that can be checked dynamically must have relevant attributes present at runtime.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Static vs. Dynamic Checking}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Static Checking
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Checks enforced at/before compile time.
        \item Only possible for properties in terms of statically-bound attributes.
        \item Implemented via a traversal of the AST (e.g. with a visitor).
        \item Can justify simpler/more efficient program evaluation (properties can be assumed).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Dynamic Checking
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Checks at runtime.
        \item Properties may depend on attributes bound statically/dynamically (or both).
        \item Can check more flexible properties (e.g. changing variable types at runtime).
        \item Info must be present at runtime.
        \item Maybe slow.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation of Static/Dynamic Checking}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Check options
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Check and complain.
        \item Check and adapt.
        \item Ignore.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Use the Visitor Pattern to implement the checking.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use ``String'' as return type.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Empty string $\rightarrow$ no error.
            \item Otherwise $\rightarrow$ error message.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Use a ``Set$<$String$>$'' parameter to keep track of currently declared variables.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Examples
    \begin{itemize}
        \item tinyVars-StaticChecks
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item What the code does
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Difficult for static analysis.
        \item Examples
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Can this method throw exceptions?
            \item Will this loop terminate?
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item What the author intended

\end{itemize}

\subsection{All-Executions and Single-Execution Properties}

\begin{itemize}

        \item Examples
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Can the method throw exceptions? $\rightarrow$ Is there any execution which does?

        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Static Program Slicing}

\begin{itemize}

    \item Examples
    \begin{itemize}
        \item L12 (18)
        \item L12 (19-20)
        \item L13 (4-17)

    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Instrumentation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Instrumenting source code
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Requires less knowledge.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Instrumenting executable
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Applies to other languages that target the same representation.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Online dynamic analysis: run the analysis as part of/alongside the program.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Influences the execution (e.g. debugger, runtime checks).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Offline dynamic analysis: make the program produce a log, then analyse it separately.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simple to implement.
        \item More efficient (but logging may still be expensive).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dynamic Program Slicing}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Process
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Create a map (variables to sets of line numbers).
        \item Update the map for every assignment statement.
        \item For branch/loop conditions
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Track a set of line numbers that represent the branch condition(s).
            \item Union these sets when assigning a variable.
            \item No changes to the map at the heads of loops/end of if-then-else.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Examples
    \begin{itemize}
        \item L13 (24)
        \item L13 (25-26)
        \item A5 (3)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Static vs. Dynamic Slicing}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Static Slicing
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The slice keeps all statements $\rightarrow$ ever relevant.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Over-estimation (imprecision due to "maybe" questions).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Dynamic Slicing
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A slice is only relevant for a single execution.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Different input states $\rightarrow$ different behaviours.
            \item Cannot be generalized.
            \item When to stop?
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Over- and Under-Approximations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Over-approximation: track at least the actual behaviours, but maybe more (e.g. static program slicing).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Including errors that never happen (false positive).
        \item Including behaviours that the program never actually exhibits.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Under-approximation: track at most the actual behaviours, but maybe less (e.g. only definite dependencies).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Missing errors that can actually happen (false negative).
        \item Missing behaviours that the program can actually exhibit.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Satisfiability}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Satisfiability problem: given a set of constraints with unknowns, do there exist values for the unknowns satisfying all constraints?
    \item Examples
    \begin{itemize}
        \item L14 (13-21)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Symbolic Execution}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A technique for exploring sets of program executions all at once.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Symbolic values: names that represent values we don't know statically (e.g. $U$, $V$).
        \item Symbolic expression: expression over symbolic values, constants, and operators (e.g. $U < V + 1$).
        \item Symbolic state: mapping from program variables to symbolic expressions (e.g. ($a \rightarrow U$, $b \rightarrow U + 2$)).
        \item Symbolic evaluation of a program expression in a symbolic state $\rightarrow$ symbolic expression
        \begin{itemize}
            \item e.g. $a + b + 7$ and ($a \rightarrow U$, $b \rightarrow U + 2$) $\rightarrow$ $U + (U + 2) + 7$ ($= 2U + 9$)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Examples
    \begin{itemize}
        \item L14 (26)
        \item L14 (27-28)
        \item L14 (29-32)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Remaining Pain Points}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Indefinitely many initial states/executions
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A (terminating) analysis can't precisely explore them all.
        \item Can ba addressed by symbolic execution.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Branch conditions
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Value-dependent alternative control ﬂow paths.
        \item Can be addressed by symbolic execution.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Loop/recursion
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Unboundedly many control ﬂow paths.
        \item Needs either over- or under-approximation.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Alias information/side effects
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Precisely tracking what changes per assignment/call.
        \item Complex symbolic states.
        \item Needs specialized static analyses.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Dynamically-determined program code
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Dynamic dispatch, reflection.
        \item Needs specialized static analyses.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Concurrency
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Race conditions, non-determination.
        \item Needs specialized static analyses.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
