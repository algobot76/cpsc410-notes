\section{Program Analysis and Visualization}

\subsection{Learning Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Differentiate the main types of program analysis, comparing their potential applications, strengths, and weaknesses.
    \item Design program analyses to extract and synthesise information to aid programmers with their daily work.
    \item Implement simple program analyses and visualizations of their results.
    \item Create useful visualizations of programming-related data.
    \item Justify the likely usefulness of program analyses and visualizations.
    \item Evaluate particular program analyses/visualizations using empirical studies.
    \item Categorise analyses according to the main types presented here, justifying which are necessary/useful for which tasks.
    \item Contrast the pros and cons of raw-data vs. static program analyses, in situations where either could be applicable.
    \item Describe the high-level implementation strategies for making large-scale static/meta-property analyses efficient.
\end{itemize}
